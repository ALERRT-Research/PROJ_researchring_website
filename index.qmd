## Welcome!

You've found the Research Ring at the ALERRT Center. This website is a clearing house for all kinds of interesting information produced and/or collected by the Ring. There are two general types of content you'll find here:

1.  **Public-facing**--Content intended for public sharing (e.g., research articles, whitepapers, web apps)

2.  **Ring-facing**--Content that is created with ourselves (or other colleagues at the ALERRT Center) in mind (e.g., instructionals, templates)

Both types of content are meant to be freely accessed and none of it is private.
